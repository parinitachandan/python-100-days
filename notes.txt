Naming Conventions

1) Naming a function
- lower case characters
- use underscore(_) instead of space

2) Naming a variable
- should start with an alphabet
- it should only contain(A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and underscore); can't contain special characters like @!#$%^&*
- it is case sensitive; for example str and Str are two different variables
- can't use reserve keyword as a variable name for example keywords like class, for, def, del, is, else, try, from, etc
- lower case other than constants

3) Naming a file
- short name
- lower case
- underscore(_) for space
- Don't name a file with a package name

4) Naming a constant
- should be capitalized always
- should be separated by an underscore(_)

5) Naming a package and module
- lowercase
- underscore(_) for space
- better to use a single word for a package name

6) General Naming Conventions
- give meaningful names; don't use x,y,z,etc
- use underscore when there is more than 1 word
- better to use camelCase when only it makes sense
[camelCase - Camel case is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation.
              It indicates the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with either case.
              Common examples include "iPhone" and "eBay"]

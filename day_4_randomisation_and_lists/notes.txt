Python uses Mersenne Twister; It is a pseudorandom number generator
Pseudorandom number generator - generates random numbers using an algorithm; also known as deterministic random bit generator
# Random processes are nondeterministic; Machines are deterministic


Random module - crated by python team to make it easy for generating random numbers without needing to get into the math to
generate pseudorandom number

Modules are simply files with the “. py” extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program
# Example in _init_.py

randint(a, b) - Returns a random integer between a and b (includes both a & b)

random.random() - Returns the next random floating point number between [0.0 to 1.0](doesn't include 1;only till 1.999);
 .random() function always generates float between 0 & 1;

Lists - way of organising and storing data in python; stores grouped pieces of data; data types can contain mixed

# variable - stores single piece of data

append()  - adds a single item into the list
extend()  - adds many pieces of data or items into a list that is already existing
insert()  - inserts an item at a given position
remove()  - removes an item from the list
pop()     - removes an item at a given index
reverse() - reverses the whole list
clear()   - removes all the items from the list

String.split() method - splits the string into a list

random.shuffle() - shuffles the sequence[lists, tuples, etc.]
random.choice()  - randomly pick up an item from a list/sequence

Index error -  that means your code is trying to access an index that is invalid
Example - fruits = ["Cherry", "Mango", "Orange", "Blackberry"] # Index only till 3
print(fruits[4]) - gives an index error

Types of Data types
    - String
    - Integer
    - Float
    - Boolean

Subscript - pulling out a particular from a string
Example
     - print("Hello"[0])
       output = H

Integers -  programming lingo for whole numbers without decimals
Examples
    - 123 + 345
    -123_345_567(python removes the underscore, it's just for humans to understand)

Float - Short for floating point number
          - decimals numbers
Example - 3.11467 or 346.9099 or 0.001

Boolean - Two possible values
        - True or False

Type Error - occurs when the data type of objects in an operation is inappropriate.
Example -  len(456789)
        error - len(456789)
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
[len function doesn't work with integers; thus the code breaks and gives a type error]

Mathematical Operators
 + Addition
 - Subtraction
 * Multiplication ( the symbol used is known as asterix)
 / Division ( forward slash)
 ** exponents or to raise power

f - String
   - provides a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax.
   - doesn't have constant value

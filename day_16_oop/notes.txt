Object-Oriented Programming:
        - Using OOP we can split a larger task into smaller pieces and each of those pieces can be worked
          on by separate teams, separate people, and also each of those pieces become reusable if we need the same;
        - Trying to model real life objects

Class:
     - A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
     - The first letter of each word is capitalized; known as pascal case; This is to differentiate it from all
       the variable and function

Object:
     - An Object is an instance of a Class

Attributes:
       - A variable associated with a modeled object
       - Things  objects have

Methods:
       - A function that a particular modeled object can do
       - Things an object can do

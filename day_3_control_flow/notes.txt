 Logical Operators or Boolean operator
 1) and - when you combine two different conditions using an and operator, both the conditions have to be true;
          if anyone condition is false, then the whole thing would be false.
 2) or - only need one of the condition to be true; if both are false, it executes false
 3) not - it reverses a condition; if the statement true, then it becomes false.

 Lower function - changes all the letters in a string to lower case letter - .lower()
